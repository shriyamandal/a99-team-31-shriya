A detailed breakdown of our planning process.

## Meeting 1: 11/20 @ 7PM
[Link to discussion post](https://github.com/orgs/comp426-2022-fall/teams/group-31/discussions/2)

Requirements:

* Documentation of planning
* An API with defined endpoints and documentation (using express.js)
* An front end interface which interacts with API and stores/retrieves user info (possibly React)
* Documentation for users

Project Idea:

API which returns information from RateMyProfessor (via scraping?), returns professor score and difficulty, and in the frontend you can input in classes and professor, get an overall quality+difficulty score for your schedule. Possibly just for CS classes/professors, could have professor quality+difficulty on a database

* Backend: having a scraper for RateMyProfessor, API runs the scraper function and has endpoints to retrieve professor information by name/professor ID
* Frontend: user enters courses, difficulty and quality of schedule is computed

## Meeting 2: 11/27 @ 7PM
